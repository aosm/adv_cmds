.Sh NAME
.Nm pstat
.Nd display system data structures
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Tfnstv
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Pstat
displays open file entry, swap space utilization,
terminal state, and vnode data structures.
If
.Ar corefile
is given, the information is sought there, otherwise
in
.Pa /dev/kmem .
The required namelist is taken from
.Pa /vmunix
unless 
.Ar system
is specified.
The
.Fl n
option specifies that devices should be printed out by major/minor
number rather than by name.
.Pp
Options are
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Print the open file table with these headings:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It CNT
Number of processes that know this open file.
.It DATA
The location of the vnode table entry or socket structure for this file.
.It FLG
Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It A
open for appending
.It I
signal pgrp when data ready
.It R
open for reading
.It S
shared lock present
.It W
open for writing
.It X
exclusive lock present
.El
.It LOC
The core location of this table entry.
.It MSG
Number of messages outstanding for this file.
.It OFFSET
The file offset (see
.Xr lseek 2 ) .
.It TYPE
The type of object the file table entry points to.
.El
.It Fl s
Print information about swap space usage
on all the swap areas compiled into the kernel.
The first column is the device name of the partition.
The next column is the total space available in the partition.  The 
.Ar Used
column indicates the total blocks used so far;  the 
.Ar Available
column indicates how much space is remaining on each partition.
The
.Ar Capacity
reports the percentage of space used.
.Pp
If more than one partition is configured into the system, totals for all
of the statistics will be reported in the final line of the report.
.It Fl T
Prints the number of used and free slots in the several system tables
and is useful for checking to see how large system tables have become
if the system is under heavy load.
.It Fl t
Print table for terminals
with these headings:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It ADDR
Physical device address.
.It CAN
Number of characters in canonicalized input queue.
.It COL
Calculated column position of terminal.
.It DEL
Number of delimiters (newlines) in canonicalized input queue.
.It DISC
Line discipline; blank is old tty
OTTYDISC
or
.Ql new tty
for
NTTYDISC
or
.Ql net
for
NETLDISC
(see
.Xr bk 4 ) .
.It MODE
See
.Xr tty 4 .
.It OUT
Number of characters in output queue.
.It PGRP
Process group for which this is controlling terminal.
.It RAW
Number of characters in raw input queue.
.It STATE
Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It A
process is awaiting output
.It B
busy doing output
.It C
carrier is on
.It F
outq has been flushed during DMA
.It H
hangup on close
.It O
open
.It S
output stopped
.It T
delay timeout in progress
.It W
waiting for open to complete
.It X
open for exclusive use
.El
.El
.It Fl v
Print the active vnodes.  Each group of vnodes corresponding
to a particular filesystem is preceded by a two line header.  The
first line consists of the following:
.Pp
.Df I
.No *** MOUNT Em fstype from 
on
.Em on fsflags
.De
.Pp
where
.Em fstype
is one of
.Em ufs , nfs , mfs , or pc ;
.Em from
is the filesystem is mounted from;
.Em on
is the directory
the filesystem is mounted on; and
.Em fsflags
is a list
of optional flags applied to the mount (see
.Xr mount 8 ) .
.The second line is a header for the individual fields ,
the first part of which are fixed, and the second part are filesystem
type specific.  The headers common to all vnodes are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It ADDR
Location of this vnode.
.It FILEID
The vnode fileid.
In the case of
.Em ufs ,
this is the inode number.
.It HOLD
The number of I/O buffers held by this vnode.
.It IFLAG
Miscellaneous filesystem specific state variables encoded thus:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It "For ufs:"
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It A
access time must be corrected
.It C
changed time must be corrected
.It E
exclusive lock applied
.It L
locked
.It M
contains modifications
.It R
has a rename in progress
.It S
shared lock applied
.It U
update time
.Pq Xr fs 5
must be corrected
.It W
wanted by another process (L flag is on)
.It Z
someone waiting for a lock
.El
.It "For nfs:"
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It E
an earlier write failed
.It G
lease was evicted (nqnfs)
.It M
locally modified data exists
.It O
write lease (nqnfs)
.It P
I/O buffers being flushed
.It W
waiting for I/O buffer flush to complete
.It X
non-cacheable lease (nqnfs)
.El
.El
.It SIZ/RDEV
Number of bytes in an ordinary file, or
major and minor device of special file.
.It TYP
File type.
.It USE
The number of references to this vnode.
.It VFLAG
A list of letters representing vnode flags:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It A
\- VALIASED
.It B
\- VBWAIT
.It E
\- VEXLOCK
.It L
\- VXLOCK
